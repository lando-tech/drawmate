Welcome to the drawmate template builder!
This tool will create a blank JSON template in the appropriate format for drawmate to use.
If you use this option, you will need to fill out Node labels, connection labels, etc...
Optionally, it will guide you in creating the entire diagram (exported via XML), if you so choose.
